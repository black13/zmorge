% Content: transducer representing abstract morphosyntactic words

% Description:
% This transducer maps lexical entries + inflectional properties to an
% abstract surface form. The surface form still has to undergo
% morphophonlogical processes to yield the final surface form.

% The handling of "-zu-" and "(-)ge-" is a bit different to SMOR:
% - <ge> is only used for non-particle verbs that form their past participle
%   with "ge-".
% - SLES has a combined marker <ge/zu> that marks the position of "-ge-" and
%   "-zu-" in particle verbs
% As in SMOR, past participles are marked with <^pp> and infinitives with
% embedded "zu" with <^zz> by flexion.fst.

% Filter imperatives for particle verbs (that are written as one orthographic
% word). 3 cases:
% 1) pass anything that is no imperative and is no particle verb
% 2) pass a particle verb only if it is no imperative
% 3) pass an imperative only if it is no particle verb; delete the imperative
%    marker

% Handle (-)ge- and -zu-. 3 cases:
% 1) pass anything that is not a past participle or infinitive with embedded
%    "-zu-"; in this case: delete <ge> and <ge/zu> if they occur
% 2) pass any past participle without a <ge> or <ge/zu> marker
% 3) <ge> and <ge/zu> are replaced by "ge" if it is a past participle;
%    delete the past participle marker
% 4) <ge/zu> is replaced by "zu" iff it is an infinitive with embedded "zu"
%    (lexical entries without <ge/zu> but with the marker for an infinitive
%     with embedded "zu" will be filtered out here)
