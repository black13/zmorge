Spelling of "s"/"ss"/"ﬂ"
========================

The old orthography requires that "ss" is written as "ﬂ" at the end of stems
(or if the inflectional suffix starts with a consonant). That means that "ﬂ"
is ambiguous in the old orthography. It is not clear whether the preceding
vowel is short or long. If it is short than "ﬂ" has to be replaced with "ss"
if followed by a vowel.

Different spellings wrt "ss" vs "ﬂ" in the old and new orthography should
be marked as "ﬂ<SS>", "ﬂ<SSalt>", or "ﬂ<SSneu>" on the lexical tape of
phon.fst. These are realised as follows:

i)   ﬂ<SS>    is spelled as "ss" in old and new orthography ("m¸ssen")
ii)  ﬂ<SSalt> is spelled as "ﬂ"  in old orthography         ("muﬂt")
iii) ﬂ<SSneu> is spelled as "ss" in new orthography         ("musst")

Furthermore, some stems ending in a simple "s", e.g. "Bus", have a double "s"
if the inflectional suffix starts with a vowel (i.e. with "e"). This should
be marked with "s<SS>" before passing results to phon.fst.

Instead of passing "<SS>", "<SSneu>", and "<SSalt>" all the time, only "<SS>"
is used, and later differentiated into all three variants. This has the
advantage that lexical entries with different word-internal spellings in the
old and new orthography (e.g. "Missverst‰ndnis" vs "Miﬂverst‰ndnis") can be
encoded using the same convention with just one representation
("Miﬂ<SS>verst‰ndnis") instead of two.

Since SMOR's inflectional classes already contain the information whether
the stem's end is affected by these orthographic rules, lexical entries do
not encode this information at the stem's end. For nouns and adjectives,
"<SS>" is inserted by the inflectional rule itself. Verbal stems always end
in "ss" in SMOR (probably because this resembles the citation form). "ss" is
replaced with "ﬂ<SS>" in inflected.fst.
